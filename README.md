# üîÅ JavaScript Loops

In our digital lives, loops quietly power most of the interactions we take for granted. One of the most widely used in JavaScript is the `for` loop. Think about when you're scrolling through a product list on an e-commerce website like Amazon or Flipkart. The site doesn't load an infinite number of products at once‚Äîinstead, it might show the first 20, then the next 20, and so on. That fixed count of items being processed in chunks is a scenario where a `for` loop fits perfectly.

Let‚Äôs say you're displaying three products from a local array, each with a name and price. The `for` loop would go through the list and render each one like this:

```javascript
let products = ['Laptop', 'Headphones', 'Smartwatch'];

for (let i = 0; i < products.length; i++) {
    console.log(`Product: ${products[i]}`);
}
```

In technical terms, the `for` loop is ideal when the number of iterations is known or easily predictable. It consists of three main parts: initialization (`let i = 0`), a condition (`i < products.length`), and an increment (`i++`). The loop executes its block as long as the condition remains true. Developers use it when they want complete control over the iteration process‚Äîlike managing indexes, skipping items conditionally, or terminating early with `break`.

## üåÄ `while` Loop

Now, think about when you‚Äôre scrolling through Instagram or TikTok. You don't tell the app in advance how many posts you want to see‚Äîit just keeps loading them as long as you‚Äôre actively scrolling. That open-ended behavior, where something continues until a condition changes, is a classic real-world parallel to a `while` loop.

Here's a simple code representation where new content loads as long as the user is still scrolling:

```javascript
let isScrolling = true;

while (isScrolling) {
    console.log("Loading next post...");
    isScrolling = Math.random() > 0.8 ? false : true; // randomly simulates stopping
}
```

Technically, a `while` loop runs its block of code **as long as** the specified condition remains true. It‚Äôs used when you don‚Äôt know beforehand how many times you need to loop. This makes it a go-to structure for scenarios involving waiting on user actions, background tasks, polling services, or game loops where the program needs to keep checking or responding until something specific happens.

## üîÅ `do...while` Loop

Every time you unlock your smartphone, whether through face recognition, fingerprint, or PIN, you always get at least one shot to attempt unlocking it. Even if you fail, the system still gives you a chance to try again. This represents a key difference from the `while` loop‚Äîthe action must happen at least once before the condition is evaluated. That‚Äôs where a `do...while` loop comes in.

Here‚Äôs an example that simulates unlocking attempts until successful:

```javascript
let isUnlocked = false;
let attempts = 0;

do {
    console.log("Attempting to unlock...");
    attempts++;
    isUnlocked = Math.random() > 0.6; // 40% chance of success
} while (!isUnlocked && attempts < 5);
```

Technically, the `do...while` loop is almost the same as the `while` loop, but the key distinction is that it guarantees the code inside the loop runs **at least once**. This is useful for user prompts, retrying failed actions, or any process where the initial attempt is non-negotiable, like setting default app settings or loading splash screens.

## üì¨ `forEach()` Loop

Let‚Äôs say you open your email app and select multiple emails to delete or archive. Each selected email goes through the same action‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs being removed, marked as spam, or moved to a folder. This repetitive, consistent behavior for each item in a list is exactly how the `forEach()` method works in JavaScript.

Here‚Äôs a code example simulating deleting selected emails:

```javascript
let selectedEmails = ['email1@example.com', 'email2@example.com', 'email3@example.com'];

selectedEmails.forEach(function(email) {
    console.log(`Deleting: ${email}`);
});
```

From a technical standpoint, `forEach()` is an array method that simplifies iteration. It doesn‚Äôt give you access to `break` or `continue`, so it‚Äôs best used when you‚Äôre performing a consistent operation across every item in a list and don‚Äôt need to interrupt the flow. It‚Äôs widely used in UI rendering, event handling, updating DOM nodes, and processing JSON data fetched from APIs.

## üóÇÔ∏è `for...of` Loop

Imagine reading a series of WhatsApp messages. You don‚Äôt care about which message is index 0 or 5‚Äîyou just want to read them in order. This represents what the `for...of` loop does: it helps you iterate through the **values** in an iterable object, not the indices.

Here‚Äôs a code example where it reads each message:

```javascript
let messages = ['Hey!', 'What‚Äôs up?', 'See you soon'];

for (let msg of messages) {
    console.log(`Reading: ${msg}`);
}
```

Technically, `for...of` was introduced in ES6 and is specifically designed for iterables like arrays, strings, maps, and sets. It provides cleaner syntax and removes the need for dealing with indexes unless they‚Äôre explicitly required. It's great for looping over form inputs, text characters, or fetched data when you only care about the value being processed.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è `for...in` Loop

Lastly, think about checking your app settings‚Äîlike toggling Wi-Fi, Dark Mode, or Notifications. These settings are stored as keys in an object, and the system reads them one by one to apply the UI state. This is where `for...in` is useful‚Äîit lets you loop through object keys.

Here‚Äôs an example:

```javascript
let settings = {
    wifi: true,
    darkMode: false,
    notifications: true
};

for (let key in settings) {
    console.log(`${key}: ${settings[key]}`);
}
```

Technically, `for...in` is for enumerating over the **keys** of an object, rather than values. It works well for dynamic forms, config files, translating key-value pairs to human-readable text, and debugging objects. However, care should be taken since it can also iterate through inherited properties unless filtered with `hasOwnProperty()`.

# ‚öôÔ∏è JavaScript Functions & Objects 
---

## üîß JavaScript Functions

Functions are one of the core building blocks in JavaScript. In real life, we use repeatable actions all the time‚Äîlike turning on a light, logging into an account, or ordering food from an app. These actions often take input (like a button press or username/password), perform a task, and return an output. In JavaScript, this behavior is perfectly captured using functions.

Imagine you're using a ride-sharing app like Uber. Every time you calculate the fare estimate, you provide the distance and time, and the app returns a price. That‚Äôs basically a function‚Äîtaking input, doing a calculation, and giving back a result.

```javascript
function calculateFare(distance, time) {
    const ratePerKm = 2;
    const ratePerMin = 0.5;
    return (distance * ratePerKm) + (time * ratePerMin);
}

console.log(calculateFare(10, 20)); // 25
```

Technically, a function in JavaScript is a reusable block of code designed to perform a specific task. It may take parameters as input and can return a result. Functions are defined using the `function` keyword or arrow syntax (`=>`), and they allow modularity, reusability, and cleaner logic separation. They're used in everything from event handlers (like button clicks), API calls, form validations, and even dynamic animations.

---

## üß† JavaScript Function Types (Just a Glimpse)

JavaScript supports multiple ways to define functions:

### Function Declaration
```javascript
function greet(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}`;
}
```

### Function Expression
```javascript
const greet = function(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}`;
};
```

Each version has its own use case, especially regarding how `this` behaves, but all represent the same functional core idea‚Äîmodular logic that can be called anywhere.

## üì¶ JavaScript Objects

Now, let‚Äôs talk about objects. In real life, everything around us is an "object"‚Äîyour smartphone, a car, a person. These objects have characteristics (properties) and behaviors (methods). For example, a phone has a brand, model, battery level (properties), and actions like turning on, taking a photo (methods). JavaScript uses objects the same way‚Äîto represent real-world entities.

Say you have a profile on Netflix. It includes your name, age, preferences, and maybe a method to recommend shows based on your history. That entire block of information and action is an object.

```javascript
const userProfile = {
    name: 'Alex',
    age: 25,
    preferences: ['Action', 'Comedy'],
    recommend: function() {
        return `Hi ${this.name}, watch some new ${this.preferences[0]} movies today!`;
    }
};

console.log(userProfile.recommend()); // Hi Alex, watch some new Action movies today!
```

Technically, an object in JavaScript is a collection of key-value pairs where each key (called a property) maps to a value. These values can be strings, numbers, arrays, or even functions (called methods). Objects are the foundation of most JavaScript programs, forming everything from user profiles to DOM elements, configuration settings, and API payloads. They're created using object literals (`{}`), constructors (`new Object()`), or class-based syntax introduced in ES6.

## üìñ Objects in Real Web Apps

In web development, objects are everywhere:

- A `user` object stores login credentials and session state.
- A `product` object contains name, price, description, and availability.
- A `form` object tracks input values, validation rules, and submission logic.
- DOM elements themselves (`document.getElementById(...)`) return objects with properties and methods.

Objects are also key when working with JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), which is the standard format for sending and receiving structured data via APIs.

# ‚ö° JavaScript Events

---

## üéØ General Context

In the real world, we interact with things and expect responses. When you press an elevator button, the door opens. When you tap a notification on your phone, it opens the app. These are events ‚Äî actions or occurrences that trigger responses. In JavaScript, **events** are how we handle user interactions and browser actions to make websites feel alive and interactive. Imagine using a music app like Spotify. You click the "Play" button, and the song starts. That click is an event. Behind the scenes, JavaScript is listening for that click and then runs a function to start playing music. Events are everywhere ‚Äî from clicking buttons, hovering over images, pressing keys, scrolling through a page, to even resizing the browser window.

---

## üíª Equivalent JavaScript Code

Here‚Äôs a simple example of how clicking a button triggers an event:

```html
<button id="playButton">Play Song</button>

<script>
    const button = document.getElementById('playButton');

    button.addEventListener('click', function() {
        console.log('Playing your favorite track!');
    });
</script>
